## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to optimize the page as such that the users could see the page according to their screen width.
Hover the main content in the page: 
# in hovering the main parts which is mentioned in the "What I learned and difficutlies" section below is the place where I faced problem.

### Screenshot

The screenshot of the designs are in the "designs" section.

### My Process

I designed it initially for the desktop design and then using "media query", then designed it for the mobile version/ for shorter width...


### Built with:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop-first workflow

### what I learned and difficulties:

I learned quite a few things here, actually first of all I would like to mention that before this project, I have never dealt with the "svg" images and their designs. But, in this project given the designs to me, it was a good experience.

Also, I learnt how to use "pseudoselectors" effectively.

Particularly, I faced problem in enabling "cursor"  on the several parts :

Issues: 
```css
.logo{
  cursor:pointer;
}

.register{
   cursor:pointer;
}

.icons{
   cursor:pointer;
}
```

Proud of the following after the "position" property was successfully implemented :

```css
.img-cont img {
    position: relative;
}
```

- Overall, I understood about the [position] property, [z-index] and [pseduselector-property] of CSS in a  better way after doing this project.


 Also,  faced  a little difficulty in adjusting the "icons" class correctly. 

### Continued development

I would use it further in my front-end skills mainly on the home page of sites to create a better UI for the users and more attractive.
